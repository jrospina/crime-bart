We looked at BART Police Reports which report on crimes that happen inside BART facilities such as trains and stations. We manually extracted the data from [PDFs](https://www.bart.gov/sites/default/files/docs/02-2022%20Monthly%20Chief%27s%20Report%20CRB%2003162022.pdf) as it's not available in other formats. 

The graphs below shows the number of Violent Crime reports by crime per county per year. Aggravated assults and robbery are the most common forms of crime when looking at the whole system.

| Five | Six | Four |

How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box. -->
