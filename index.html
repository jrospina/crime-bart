<title>Motivation</title>

<p>Safety and crime have the potential to affect travel mode choice. For example, female-identifying individuals are known to experience incidents of crime, such as sexual harassement, that make them feel unsafe and cause them to adjust their travel behavior to avoid public transit. To increase ridership, transit systems must address the varying needs of their riders to guarantee continued use of their systems.</p>

<p>On this site we explore crime and ridership data for the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and the City and County of San Francisco. In particular, we seek to answer the question: What is the spatial distribution of reported crime incidents around BART stations? This is meant to be a preliminary exploration to shed light on the possible relationship between crime and BART ridership. </p>

This is a test. Someday, there will be a nicer box here!
